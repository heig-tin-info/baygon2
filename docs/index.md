# Welcome to Baygon

Baygon is a lightweight framework that makes it easy to describe and run functional tests for executables with YAML or JSON. The documentation gathered here was originally written for the first version of Baygon and now lives alongside the modernised code base.

Use the navigation to dive into the topics that interest you or follow the suggested reading order below:

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) introduces the main concepts and shows how to run your first tests.
- [Config file syntax](syntax.md) lists every option available in the configuration files.
- [Advanced](advanced.md) collects tips for more involved test suites.
- [Academic assignment](score.md) explains how to distribute points.
- [Scripting](scripting.md) demonstrates how to drive Baygon programmatically.
- [Contributing](contributing.md) describes how to help the project grow.

Have fun squashing bugs!
